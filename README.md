# misc
A chest box with a bunch useless scripts.

* greetings.ts

  A script to print greetings in multiple langageS, inspired by Stathis Goudoulakis, [Hello In All Languages](https://github.com/stathisg/hello-in-all-languages/blob/master/hello-in-all-languages.php) in TypeScript for pure browser-side fun.

  The greeting is chosen randomly amongst language and printed out in an HTML DOM Element named *greeting*.

* mailurlBuilder.ts

  A lame attempt to fool a very simple email crawler: top-notch encrypted  mail URL approved by *Imperator Iulius Caesar Divus* and DOM trickery hook.

  The email is bound to an HTML DOM Element named *mailhref*.
