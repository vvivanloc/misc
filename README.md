A chest box with a bunch useless scripts.

* greetings.ts

  A script to print greetings in multiple langages, inspired by Stathis Goudoulakis, [Hello In All Languages](https://github.com/stathisg/hello-in-all-languages/blob/master/hello-in-all-languages.php). Now in TypeScript for pure browser-side fun. Bonus: all country names bound to greetings are available in english and french with its definite article.

  The greeting is chosen randomly amongst language and printed out in an HTML DOM Element named *greeting*.

* mailurlBuilder.ts

  A lame attempt to fool a very simple email crawler: top-notch encrypted  mail URL approved by *Imperator Iulius Caesar Divus* and DOM trickery hook.

  The email is bound to an HTML DOM Element named *mailhref*.
